[Nx Documentation](https://nx.dev/angular)

## Generate a library

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

Libraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@new-sample-platform/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve api (or sample platform)` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g component my-component --project=app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `ng build api (or sample-platform)` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test sample-platform` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
